To run the neural networks, simply run the script. Right now, the neural network using pytorch is set up for 9 layers with width of 100. It is easy to change the width, simply change the parameter called inside the net function. To change the number of layers, one must go in and alter the network architecture. The shell file for these scripts are included in the logistic regression folder.
