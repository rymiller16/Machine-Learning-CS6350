I was not able to complete homework 1 trying to perform ID3 in MATLAB. After speaking with the TA about this, he recomended I switch to python and even though
I would be too late to get points back for HW1, I would need ID3 for Homework 2. Over Fall break, I reworked Homework 1 in python and was able to implement
the ID3 algorithm.
